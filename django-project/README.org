Setup with:

- =uv init django-project=
- =cd django-project=
- =uv add Django=
- =uv run django-admin --version=

Adding to Git is fine (it seems =.venv= is already ignored).

No reinstall of environment needed on fresh check-out: =uv run= fetches as required.

With some AI help:

- =uv run django-admin startproject config .=
- =uv run python manage.py runserver=
- =.gitignore-= created by AI
